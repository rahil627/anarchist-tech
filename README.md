tools for the people

see my noteobooks for most important tools, then list, then make! :)

can use ai to write the skeleton of apps, and maybe even the skeletons of most features(!)
c/try using ruby/sinatra for web apps, or flutter for a more systems programming style
  - decided to use elixir/phoenix

p/start with the simple mapping apps
  - https://github.com/rahil627/mapping-app-base

after finishing that, it should be easy to execute the rest of the ideas

only the AR/VR idea will require a different front-end, but the back-end could still use elixir/phoenix!
